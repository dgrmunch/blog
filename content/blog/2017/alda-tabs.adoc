NOTE: This post explains how to easily compose music with `alda-tabs`, a *Domain Specific Language for Guitar Players* which runs in the JVM. I have developed `alda-tabs` as an _open source_ project so you can download it for free in {alda-tabs-repo-url}[GitHub].

=== What is alda-tabs?

* It is a Domain Specific Language for guitar players.
* It is a piece of software to help guitar players to
"execute" their music notes in the `JVM`, compose songs and get audio feedback.
* It is an extensible tool for music programming mainly
oriented to guitar players.
* It is built on the top of `Alda`, a DSL for
music composition in the JVM, so it is compatible with both `Alda` and `Clojure`.

=== Why is so easy to code guitar songs with alda-tabs?

* It does not require programming skills.
* It does not require traditional music notation.
* It is as straightforward as writing simple guitar sketches in a
notebook.
* You only have to copy your tabs from the paper to a text editor and
execute `alda-tabs`.

=== How can I create complex digital music with alda-tabs?

* With `alda-tabs` you can execute any _.alda_ file, so you can write
your songs/programs in both `Clojure`, `Alda` and `alda-tabs` in the same
block of text.
* It talks to the `JVM`, so any experimented programmer can do impossible
things :-)
* It is just a layer on the top of `Alda`, so if you know music theory,
then you can write complex songs using music notation.

=== How is the alda-tabs syntax?

NOTE: Remember that with *alda-tabs* you can always use the standard
Alda syntax and Clojure code. You can learn more about both languages
later to explore the whole potential of __alda-tabs__. But don't worry,
you don't need to know more yet. Just follow this tutorial and enjoy :)

What I am gonna show you here is the easy and super simple _alda-tabs_
syntax:

* The *tab notation*
* The *chord notation*

In 10 minutes you will be able to write songs in a text editor and
listen the result in your speakers.

==== Tab notation
Imagine that you want to play all the strings of the guitar, one after
another:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgrmunch/alda-tabs/master/img/score1.png[role=white-img]

This example is a regular _guitar tab_ in which all the strings are played sequentially with one hand and in which there are not fingers of the other hand pressing the fret.

*So the fret number would be `0` in the six positions of the sequence.*

[Tip]
====

*How would we write this in `Alda` syntax?*

_Don't worry, I will explain how to do it in `alda-tabs` syntax bellow (see <<how-to-do-it-in-alda-tabs>>) but it is important to read this before to compare `alda-tabs` with_ `Alda`.


In `Alda` syntax we would need to know the note equivalents of each position. And in addition:

 *  We would write the octave and the note, one after another:

....
guitar: o4 e o3 b o3 g o3 d o2 a o2 e
....

 *  Another way would be to write the initial octave increasing/decreasing it
when needed:

....
guitar: o4 e/>b/g/d/<<a/e
....

How to do it in alda-tabs?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remember that _alda-tabs_ is based in the simple concept of a tab.
Basically, the notes of a guitar can be defined by numeric combinations,
a number to identify the string (from the first at the bottom to the
sixth at the top) and a fret.

To write a note in _alda-tabs_ you only have to write `ta` followed by
the `string number` and the `fret number`.

With `alda-tabs` we can write the same sequence that we have previously
expressed in `Alda`. But this time we don't need to know which note we are
playing, we only need to write the __tab__, the position of our finger
considering the _string_ and the __fret__:

....
 guitar: ta10 ta20 ta30 ta40 ta50 ta60
....

In this example, we are asking the JMV to play a guitar with the open strings 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, one after another. That is, `ta10` equals *string 1* and *fret 0* and so on.

Take a look now of the fretboard:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgrmunch/alda-tabs/master/img/notes-fret.png[role=white-img]

If you want to play the first note *C*, according to the graphic displayed above, you don't need to know the octave, you just will pick the *string 2* in the *fret 1*: `ta` + `2` + `1`.
....

guitar: ta21
....

You can also modify the duration of a note adding a character at the
end. For example:

....
guitar: ta21 ta21W ta21Q ta21D ta21H
....

What does it mean? If you don't specify a duration, this will be *whole
beat* (`W`). You can also play the note during half beat (`H`), double (`D`)
and quarter (`Q`). Those note durations will be proportional to the tempo
of the score. For example, the following two sentences are not the same:

....
(tempo 100)
guitar: ta21 ta21W ta21Q ta21D ta21H
....

....
(tempo 300)
guitar: ta21 ta21W ta21Q ta21D ta21H
....

__Play with this combinations to see the difference__. For more complex
timing, check the _advanced tips_ bellow.

[[chord-notation]]
Chord notation
--------------

Imagine that rather than a sequence of notes you want to play a chord. A
basic example would be playing all the open strings at the same time:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgrmunch/alda-tabs/master/img/score2.png[role=white-img]

You can do this in three ways:

* In `Alda` syntax, using the character `/` to play the notes at the same
time:

....
guitar: o4 e/>b/g/d/<<a/e
....

* In `alta-tabs` syntax, using the _tab notation_ with different voices:

....
guitar: V1: ta10 V2: ta20 V3: ta30 V4: ta40 V5: ta50 V6: ta60
....

* In `alta-tabs` syntax, but using the **chord notation**:

....
guitar: (c 0 0 0 0 0 0 W)
....

As you can see, the chord notation is just a `Clojure` function `c` with
seven parameters, the fret of each one of the six strings and the
duration of the chord.

For example, the D chord would be

....
(c 2 3 2 0 x x W)
....

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgrmunch/alda-tabs/master/img/re.png[role=white-img]

You can also use the _chord notation_ to play single notes. For example,
the two following sequences are exactly the same:

....
# alta-tab syntax

ta10 ta20 ta30 ta40 ta50 ta60

# alda-tab chord syntax

(c 0 x x x x x W)
(c x 0 x x x x W)
(c x x 0 x x x W)
(c x x x 0 x x W)
(c x x x x 0 x W)
(c x x x x x 0 W)
....

[[advanced-tips]]
Advanced tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can play tabs with specific durations, in seconds or milliseconds by
using the function `t`. In this case you should write the number of
the string, followed by a dot and the fret. Add the end, you should
express in String format ("") the duration you want.

....
guitar: (t 1.0 "2s") (t 2.0 "10ms") (t 2.2 "100ms")
....

You can do the same with your chords:

....
guitar: (c 0 x 1 2 2 x "5s")
....

[[how-can-i-install-alta-tabs]]
How can I install alta-tabs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Follow the https://github.com/alda-lang/alda[steps to install Alda].
*  Clone {alda-tabs-repo-url}[this repo] and open the folder `alda-tabs` in your terminal.
*  Run the Alda server with `alda up`.
* Create a simple text file, write your song using the alda-tabs
syntax and save it.
*  Execute `./alda-tabs.sh` followed by the path of the file you want
to play.
*  Listen the result.
*  If you want to stop a song you can stop the alda server with
`alda down`.

NOTE: You can also play some scores (provided in the `/examples`
folder) and modify their content to explore different sounds.

== Examples

NOTE: In this document you can both read the code and listen the output of its execution in `alda-tabs`. However, the provided audio file is **non-stereo**. The original output of `alda-tabs`, however, includes `panning`. So explore the real result executing the code/song in your own instance of `alda-tabs`.

=== Example 1: Chords and arpeggios
You can start exploring the potential of _alda-tabs_ with chords and arpeggios
with the *example #01*:

....

./alda-tabs.sh examples/01-guitartabs-example.alda

....

audio::{songs}/examples/example1.mp3[role=music-box]

:linkattrs:
link:{alda-tabs-repo}/examples/01-guitartabs-example.alda[" Read alda-tabs code", role="fa fa-file code", window="_blank"]

'''

=== Example 2: The sound of Pi

Try to compose _mathematical songs_ extending _Alda_ and _alda-tabs_
with __Clojure__. See the *example #02*:

....

./alda-tabs.sh examples/02-pi.alda

....

audio::{songs}/examples/example2.mp3[role=music-box]

:linkattrs:
link:{alda-tabs-repo}/examples/02-pi.alda[" Read alda-tabs code", role="fa fa-file code", window="_blank"]

'''

=== Example 3: Chords and arpeggios

You can also see how beautiful songs with multiple instruments can be
written with Alda with the *example #03*:

....

./alda-tabs.sh examples/03-hope-for-future-ext.alda

....

audio::{songs}/examples/example3.mp3[role=music-box]
